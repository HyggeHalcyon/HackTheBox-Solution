Needle designs for Darius Simion.
From drbrown@hospital.htb on 2023-10-23 22:40

Dear Lucy,

I wanted to remind you that the project for lighter, cheaper and
environmentally friendly needles is still ongoing ðŸ’‰. You are the one in
charge of providing me with the designs for these so that I can take
them to the 3D printing department and start producing them right away.
Please make the design in an ".eps" file format so that it can be well
visualized with GhostScript.

Best regards,
Chris Brown.
